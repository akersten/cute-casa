# cute-casa
A centralized home management system; rent payment/lease administration, IoT integration, maintenance reminders, dashboards

See the splash page at [http://cute.casa](http://cute.casa).

## Overview

CuteCasa is a self-hosted house administration system. Through online dashboards, you can control every aspect of your
IoT-enabled house, split bills, manage rent, delegate tasks, and more.

## Technologies

* Python
* * Flask
* jQuery
* Sass
* [Bulma](http://bulma.io)

## Setup

Being a self-hosted solution, you'll need to run this on your own equipment. The cute.casa website is intended for
future paid/dedicated hosting.

### Requirements

* Python (3.4+)
* * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* * [ZODB](http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (`sass`)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (`tsc`)
* pytesseract (requires python3-image package and Tesseract OCR package)

### Running CuteCasa

Create a shell script to load the variables in cute.py and to launch the program:

    #!/bin/sh
    export CUTE_DB="config/secret/cute.db"
    export CUTE_DEBUG="False"
    export CUTE_SECRET_KEY="set a secret development key"
    export CUTE_USERNAME="admin"
    export CUTE_PASSWORD="set a secret password"
    export CUTE_PORT="5050"
    export CUTE_SALT="16 or so good random bytes"
    python3 cute.py

Set it executable (`chmod +x run.sh`) and run it (`./run.sh`). If everything's set up correctly, CuteCasa will now be
running on your server. Obviously don't commit this file into VCS.
