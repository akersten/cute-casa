Longterm TODO
===

[] Consistent formatting, e.g. '' vs "" in python, linting all files, camelCase vs dashed-case for css, number of tab spaces
[] Review what endpoints actually need post instead of just get requests in cute.py
[] Add proper pydoc :raises: documentation and other method header items
[] Indentaiton spacing (e.g. be consistent about 2 vs 4 spaces in css files)
[] Rename jinja2 macros imported as "shared" to "macros"
